# 🚀 Structural Prime Explorer (SPE) Demo (UPL)

**A glimpse into the deterministic mathematics of the Universal Prime Law.**

This repository contains a **limited-function executable binary** demonstrating the accuracy and power of the Structural Prime Law (UPL) framework. This demo is designed to showcase the model's ability to predict prime number distribution with unprecedented precision.

### 🛑 Demo Limitations

This executable is restricted to low-magnitude primes ($P < 1,000,000$) and certain advanced exploration modes (like the Structural Law Tracer) are disabled. The full version allows for high-magnitude prime prediction and comprehensive structural analysis.

### 🔑 Full Access & Commercial Licensing

The complete, unrestricted source code (SPE v5.6), which includes the full set of proprietary constants and formulas necessary for high-magnitude and commercial applications, is available under a separate license agreement.

**For full access, commercial use, and high-magnitude prime exploration, please inquire about licensing the complete Universal Prime Law (UPL) Intellectual Property.**
